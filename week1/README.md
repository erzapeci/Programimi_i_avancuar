1.Why I chose Python
1.I selected Python because it's widely used for AI development and is known for its simplicity and versatility in solving a range of tasks.

2.How I used the AI tool
2.I provided clear and specific requests, mentioning the programming language I wanted to use and gave examples to help the AI understand my needs.

3.Helpful suggestions from the AI
3.One useful suggestion was encapsulating the greeting logic into a function, which helped make my code cleaner and more organized.

4.Suggestions I modified or corrected
4.I had to modify instructions for reinstalling or repairing Python in VS to fix the "Failed to resolve env" issue.

5.What I learned about AI-assisted coding
5.I learned how to import the datetime module to get the current date and time, define functions like greet_user(name) for cleaner code, handle errors with try-except blocks, and add comments to improve code readability and documentation.
